            FILE - In this Sunday Aug. 23, 2020 file photo, 
            UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin speaks during 
            an interview with The Associated Press in Lisbon, 
            Portugal. Ceferin has directly appealed to owners 
            of English clubs in the Super League project to 
            change their minds out of respect for soccer fans. 
            Ceferin both cajoled and criticized the six-club 
            English group which includes American billionaires,
            Arab royalty and a Russian oligarch. They launched 
            the Super League plan in alliance with three clubs 
            from each of Italy and Spain. Ceferin tells them 
            “Gentlemen, you made a huge mistake.” 
            He says it doesn't matter if they acted out of 
            "arrogance, flippancy or complete ignorance of 
            England’s football culture. The UEFA president 
            says there's time to change their minds.
