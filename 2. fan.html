            Fans celebrate after hearing the unofficial 
            news that plans for a new European 
            Super League have been cancelled, 
            during protests by Chelsea fans outside 
            Stamford Bridge stadium in London, 
            against Chelsea's decision to be included 
            amongst the clubs attempting to form a 
            new European Super League, Tuesday, 
            April 20, 2021. Reaction to the proposals 
            from 12 clubs to rip up European soccer by 
            forming a breakaway Super League has ranged 
            from anger and condemnation to humor and sarcasm.
