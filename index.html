            The withdrawal announcements came amid multiple
            reports on Tuesday that the 12 members of the breakaway 
            Super League were meeting to discuss the future of the 
            competition, first reported by TalkSPORT. 
            CNN has reached out to the Super League for comment but 
            has not heard back.
            Initial plans to form the breakaway Super League 
            laid out on Sunday would have included six English 
            clubs -- Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, 
            Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur -- alongside 
            three teams from Italy -- AC Milan, Inter Milan and 
            Juventus -- and three from Spain -- Atl√©tico Madrid, 
            Barcelona and Real Madrid.
